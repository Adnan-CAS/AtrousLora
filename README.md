# AtrousLora: AI-powered Vascular Segmentation Model
AtrousLora is an advanced deep learning model designed to automate the segmentation of vascular structures in medical imaging. Based on the powerful SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture and enhanced with AtrousLora, it provides robust and reliable segmentation results, which are crucial for medical professionals in tasks such as diagnostic imaging and surgical planning.

Built with flexibility and performance in mind, AtrousLora utilizes cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and innovative methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and Atrous Attention to enhance the segmentation process. It is optimized for high accuracy, even in complex cases where manual segmentation is time-consuming and prone to human error. AtrousLora aims to reduce the workload of healthcare professionals, enabling them to make more efficient and accurate decisions in patient care. Vascular segmentation will be particularly useful for treatment planning and disease diagnosis, helping clinicians visualize and analyze blood vessels for better clinical decisions.

This project offers an easy-to-use framework that can be seamlessly integrated into medical imaging workflows, delivering high-quality segmentation results with minimal input. The model is designed to work across a wide variety of imaging modalities, making it a versatile tool for numerous applications in the healthcare sector.

### Note: The rest of the details and the code will be released soon.
